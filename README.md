# R_Projects
Projects using R programming language for data analytics and statistics

## Basic statistics: 
- plotting time series data
- fitting a linear model to a set of ordered pairs
- assess normality of residuals: normal prob. plot 
- Test whether the slope of the fittel line is zero: hypothesis tests (t-tests) and confidence intervals

Assumptions of simple linear regression:
1. errors are normally distributed with an average of zero: E[eps_i] = 0
2. errors have the same variance - homoscedasticity: Var[eps_i] = constant
3. errors are independent of each other across observations: Cov[eps_i, eps_j] = 0 for all i != j

-slope: b1 = SSxy/SSxx ; intercept: b0 = mean(y) - b1*mean(x)
